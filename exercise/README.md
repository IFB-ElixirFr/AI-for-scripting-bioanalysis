# ðŸ§ª Practical Exercise : Using Generative AI to Implement a Script for Analysing a Biological Dataset


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The aim of this exercise is to explore the ability of generative AI models to assist in coding a simple, real-world biological data analysis task. 
Participants will prompt a generative AI (such as Mistral, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or another of their choice) to generate a complete and reproducible analysis script. 

The focus is not on solving the task yourself, but on interacting effectively with the AI to generate high-quality code that performs the desired analysis.

At the end of the exercise, participants will critically assess the usefulness of the AI model in supporting scientific programming.

## ðŸ§¬ Datasets

You will be given a tabular biological dataset (e.g., phenotypic data, sample metadata, microbial counts, protein properties, etc.). The dataset will be designed to be easily understood **without requiring in-depth domain knowledge**.

## ðŸ”§ Tasks to be Completed (by the AI, via your prompts)

The AI-generated script should be capable of performing the following:

1. **Loading the dataset** (TSV or CSV file)
2. **Basic exploration and summary statistics**
   - Number of rows/columns
   - Summary of each column (mean, median, missing values, etc.)
3. **Generating derived tables**
   - Marginal statistics per row/column (e.g., total counts, averages)
4. **Exporting derived tables**
   - Save as `.tsv` (tab-separated values)
   - Save as `.xlsx` (Excel format)
5. **Producing visualisations**
   - Examples: boxplots, violin plots, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps
   - Figures should highlight patterns or differences in the dataset
6. **Exporting figures**
   - Save as `.png` and `.pdf`

The final script should:
- Be **documented** (with meaningful comments and function documentation)
- Be **structured** (with reusable functions or modular sections)
- Be **reusable** (easily applied to another dataset with the same format)

## ðŸ§­ Procedure

1. **Choose your AI model**: You may use any generative AI model you prefer (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude). You are encouraged to try more than one.
2. **Choose your scripting language**: You may use Python, "classic" R, or tidyverse-style R. We will provide support for these.
3. **Interact with the AI**:
   - Clearly explain the task to the AI.
   - Provide the dataset format or sample lines if necessary.
   - Ask the AI to generate the complete analysis script.
   - Review, test, and refine the script with the AI until it works.
4. **Evaluate the results**:
   - Check if the script runs without manual fixes.
   - Review the output tables and figures.
   - Evaluate the documentation and code structure.
5. **Fill out the survey** (see below).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started Instructions

1. **Download the dataset** (you will receive a file in `.tsv` format).
2. **Set up your working environment** (Python or R, local or notebook).
3. **Open your chosen generative AI tool**.
4. **Prompt the AI**: Start by describing the task, for example:
